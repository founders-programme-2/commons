# Game prototype (Figma Feedback)

### NOTE: Quip is constantly being updated. This document was copied at 6:30pm April 12 2019

Here's comments and issues from David and Drew. Summary of issues:

- Focus first on the building a Community Commons team case - consider whether we can work on building a network commons; also whether we can a community/network connector case
- Do we have more info content about Theory behind the game - can be later. Priority is something testable.
- In choosing the scenario, can we add in personas and organisation as commons users
- Can we add a challenges section to sharpen up choice of tools
- we need to review/add to categorisation of tools - finding, sharing , collaborating
- It would be good to have a print tools option to help people scan/discuss tools, then input choices

In addition

- Need to decide whether to use methods or tools as terms. - use methods
- Should I now split this content up on to separate Quip pages, which might then become a web version?

## User flow instructions:

Numbering relates to Figma screens.

1. Landing page: When ready, click the arrow to continue

Revise to: A game to develop and use a commons platforms for communities and networks

2. About Commons introduction: When ready, click “next” to continue

add commons as a space open to anyone ... building spaces open to anyone. do some definitions

Later there may be two pre-set scenario options - Slipham Commons and Slipham networks. We have keen interest from a consortium of four equalities networks, funded by Big Lottery, that we are working with. Our remit is to develop maps, comms, and a learning space. Very good fit.

Main use cases could be 1) to run a workshop and build the commons - as described here - or 2) how to use the Commons platform as a community connector. An interesting comparison would be 3) as a connector without the platform. But that may be later development!

Link to theory here

3. How to play Instructions page: Currently a placeholder until we have the right copy. When ready, click “next” to continue

We need to look at this - see How to Create a Commons in https://quip.com/qCctAn5dBfDY Do we have a branch to Theory behind the game?

Do we have play as a Commons developer (as now), plus play as a community connector?

- Main sequence

  - Choose and understand your scenario - the situation, and people you wish to support (scenario plus some personas)
  - Review the challenges you wish to address - how might we .. how can I
  - Choose the methods you will use
  - Organise your toolkit and develop a plan
  - Learn how to use your tools

4. Choose your game play Scenario selection: Click “Play a random scenario” to continue.

For the MVP are we just going to do Slipham Commons, or could we do Slipham Networks as well? That would be good for our job with equalities networks. (as mentioned)

5. Your scenario Scenario summary: When ready, click “next” to continue

Should there be additional screens here (see https://quip.com/qCctAn5dBfDY)

- Personas - examples of the people and organisations that the Commons will serve
- Challenges. For the Commons development case, the challenges could refer to the personas as users

If we have a community connector use, we could have an option to explore what the commons might be like, with hub/platform cards we have selected. Then the connector adds their own personal-use tools?

6. Select Your Tools page: Click on “More information”

Before going straight into tools, should we have an explanation that tools are categorised Finding, sharing privately, sharing publicly, collaborating. Where we focus on the Commons development use, the tools could be like the ones in https://quip.com/qCctAn5dBfDY. If we have a community connector use there could be more personal methods as well as the ability to use the platform methods.

Could we do a summary of tools before going through one by one?

If the use is by the Commons development team, they are more likely to be working a tablet or computer. Could we have print off, discuss as a team, and input choices?

7. Select Your Tools page: Click on the checkbox for “Use this resource”

I like the way this works ... if we can work out the categorisation - Finding, Sharing, Collaborating (to be agreed)

8. Select Your Tools page: Click on the arrow to see the next available tool

9. Select Your Tools page: Imagining that we have gone through the process of selecting as many tools as we could with the resources that we were allocated, click on the checkbox for “Use this resource” to advance to the final selection.

10. Select Your Tools page: When ready, click “next” to continue

11. Prioritize Your Tools page: Imagining that we have selected a ‘low’ priority and ‘short term’ time frame, click “done” to continue

12. Selection Summary: This is currently our last page! There is still work to be done as far as how information is displayed. We opted not to include the table due to the mobile view, but believe that it might be possible by using icons to represent the cards. We are open to feedback though.
